# Flinder

Flinder is a wafer imaging system with a graphical interface that allows you to automatically hunt for van der Waals material flakes.
You will need to have a microscope with a X,Y,Z motorized stage controlled by Nikon NIS element software.

I am working on a second version based on pymmCore and micromanager that will circonvent that limitation.
